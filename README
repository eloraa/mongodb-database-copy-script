mongodb-database-copy-script

I created a simple script to copy the MongoDB collection to another database for my personal requirements.

Getting Started
To get you started you can simply clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/eloraa/mongodb-database-copy-script


and install the dependencies

yarn


Prerequisites
You need git to clone the repository. You can get git from
https://git-scm.com/

A number of node.js tools is necessary to initialize and test the project. You must have node.js and its package manager (npm) installed. You can get them from  https://nodejs.org/. The tools/modules used in this project are listed in package.json and include yarn, and other packages.

Usage:

node ./copy <sourceDBname> <targetDBname> --source <sourceDBurl> --target <targetDBurl>
